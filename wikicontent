Leagues Cup
Main article: 2023 Leagues Cup
Both knockout stage games were hosted by FC Cincinnati at TQL Stadium. Led by Brandon Vazquez with 4 goals, the club advanced to the knockout stage of the Leagues Cup after securing a penalty shootout win against Sporting Kansas City [51] and a two-day victory against Club Deportivo Guadalajara. The Chivas game was initially played on Thursday, July 28th, but was halted in the 60th minute for a lengthy severe weather delay. When the game finally resumed 18.5 hours later, the calendar read Friday, July 29th. The final wrinkle was that it was decided to finish the final 30 minutes "behind closed doors" as a safety precaution for staff, players and fans.[52]

The Orange and Blue hosted Nashville SC in their Round of 32 matchup at TQL Stadium on August 4, 2023. The game ended tied 1–1 after 90 minutes with goals from Anibal Godoy of Nashville SC and Brandon Vazquez via penalty kick, his 5th in Leagues Cup play, of FC Cincinnati. Nashville advanced to the Round of 16 via penalty kicks (5–4).[53]
